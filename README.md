# Linear Regression (9/23/2020)
This script is developed from scratch to practice the linear regression.
The data used in training and testing can be found in "Data" folder.

# Ridge Regression (9/24/2020)
This script is developed from scratch to practice the ridge regression,
which is the linear regression plus L2 regularization.
The data used in training and testing can be found in "Data" folder.

# Lasso Regression (9/25/2020)
This script is developed from scratch to practice the ridge regression,
which is the linear regression plus L1 regularization.
The data used in training and testing can be found in "Data" folder.

# Logistic Regression (9/28/2020)
This script is developed from scratch to practice the logistic regression.
The data used in training and testing are the iris dataset from Sklearn.

# Two-Layers Neural Network
This notebook shows the basic idea for two-layers neural network and how to develop it from scratch as well as use Tensorflow and Pytorch.
The architecture of the neural network is connected by two forward pass, one rectified linear unit (ReLU) and one softmax function. 
Forward pass combine the input feature and the hidden laery by weights and bias. 
ReLU is general nonlinear part within modern neural network and softmax can generate multi-class probability for the prediction.

# Support Vector Machine & Adaboost
This notebook shows hoe SVM and Adaboost work to classify two digits. The two methods are developed from scratch. By given simple examples, two methods both give 90%+ training and testing accuracy.
