# Linear Regression
This script is developed from scratch to practice the linear regression.
The data used in training and testing can be found in "Data" folder.

# Two-Layers Neural Network
This notebook shows the basic idea for two-layers neural network and how to develop it from scratch as well as use Tensorflow and Pytorch.
The architecture of the neural network is connected by two forward pass, one rectified linear unit (ReLU) and one softmax function. 
Forward pass combine the input feature and the hidden laery by weights and bias. 
ReLU is general nonlinear part within modern neural network and softmax can generate multi-class probability for the prediction.

# Support Vector Machine & Adaboost
This notebook shows hoe SVM and Adaboost work to classify two digits. The two methods are developed from scratch. By given simple examples, two methods both give 90%+ training and testing accuracy.
